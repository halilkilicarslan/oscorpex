# Oscorpex

AI-powered software development platform — describe your idea, let AI agents build it.

Oscorpex is a full-stack development studio that orchestrates a team of 12 specialized AI agents (Scrum methodology) to plan, build, test, review, and deploy software projects autonomously through a DAG pipeline.

## Features

### Core Engine
- **12-Agent Scrum Team** — PM, Designer, Architect, Frontend Dev, Backend Dev, QA, Code Reviewer, Security Analyst, DevOps, Tech Lead, Scrum Master, UX Researcher
- **DAG Pipeline Engine** — Kahn's algorithm-based dependency resolution with 12 edge types, phase progression, and automatic wave dispatch
- **Claim-Based Task Dispatch** — `SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` prevents duplicate dispatch across concurrent workers
- **Review Loop** — iterative code review cycle with rejection → revision → re-review, escalation/fallback edges. Review blocking: phase/stage cannot complete until review resolves
- **Task Decomposition** — AI Scrum Master auto-decomposes L/XL tasks into micro-tasks with dependency graphs
- **Model Routing** — complexity-based model selection with auto-tier bump on retry/rejection, cost-aware downgrade, and project-level policy profile overrides
- **Multi-Provider Execution** — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Google Gemini, Ollama (local) with automatic fallback chain and graceful degraded mode

### Agentic Runtime (v7.0+)
- **Episodic Memory** — per-agent execution episodes with behavioral context for prompt injection and failure avoidance
- **Strategy Selection** — 9 builtin strategies across 5 roles, historical pattern-derived selection with cross-project learning
- **Agent Sessions** — bounded runtime context with observation-action loop recording (4 lifecycle steps per task)
- **Inter-Agent Protocol** — structured messaging (request_info, blocker_alert, handoff_artifact, design_decision) with blocking enforcement
- **Task Injection** — agents propose tasks via structured output markers (`<!-- TASK_PROPOSAL: {...} -->`), auto-approve low-risk
- **Dynamic Coordination Graph** — runtime DAG mutations (insert_node, split_task, add/remove_edge, defer_branch) with full audit trail
- **Adaptive Replanner** — phase-boundary replanning with 6 trigger types, 5 patch actions, pipeline gate on pending approval
- **Goal-Based Execution** — LLM-validated success criteria with advisory/enforced modes

### Safety & Enforcement (v8.0)
- **Sandbox Enforcement** — hard/soft/off modes with tool governance, path traversal checks, output size limits. Pre-execution gate blocks denied tools before CLI spawn
- **Execution Workspace Isolation** — unified contract (local/isolated/container) with file-copy isolation, write-back enforcement, and path safety validation
- **Budget Guard** — cost circuit breaker with auto-pause on budget breach (`maxCostUsd` canonical key)
- **Risk Classification** — auto-classify task risk level, high-risk tasks require approval before execution
- **Role Normalization** — canonical hyphen-case format with underscore/legacy variant acceptance
- **Approval Timeout** — 24h auto-escalation for stalled approvals
- **Control Plane** — operator governance layer with registry, presence, approvals, audit, incidents, and policy surface
- **Operator Actions** — 7 controlled actions: provider disable/enable, task retry/cancel, queue pause/resume, cooldown reset with mandatory audit logging
- **Incident Management** — full workflow: acknowledge, assign, resolve, reopen, add notes, severity updates with event timeline
- **Approval SLA** — real-time age tracking, expiration warnings, escalation support
- **Policy Explainability** — active policy profiles, budget status, recent decision visibility
- **RLS Tenant Guard** — row-level security on 14+ tables with request-scoped tenant context

### Performance & Scheduling (v9.0)
- **Adaptive Concurrency** — dynamic semaphore (1–10) auto-adjusted every 30s based on failure rate and queue depth
- **Fair Scheduling** — short tasks first, then retry count, then FIFO
- **Retry Policy** — classification-aware retry with exponential backoff (max 3 retries)
- **Timeout Policy** — provider × complexity × project multiplier timeout resolution (S/M/L/XL tiers)
- **Provider Cooldown** — trigger-aware cooldown (unavailable 30s, spawn_failure 60s, repeated_timeout 90s)
- **Provider State Manager** — per-adapter rate-limit and failure tracking with DB persistence
- **Cost-Aware Model Selection** — automatic downgrade to cheaper models per tier when failures are low
- **Preflight Warmup** — cold-start tracking + preflight health checks before task dispatch
- **Provider Policy Profiles** — 5 profiles (`balanced`, `cheap`, `quality`, `local-first`, `fallback-heavy`) with project-level routing overrides

### Observability & Metrics
- **11 Aggregation Queries** — claim latency (avg/p95), duplicate dispatch, verification failure rate, strategy success rates, review rejection by role, injected task volume (human/auto split), graph mutation stats, replan trigger frequency (by status), degraded provider duration, failure classification (transient/terminal/retry-exhausted)
- **Cross-Project Learning** — anonymized pattern extraction from episodes, auto-promotion (≥10 samples, ≥70% success), 0.8x confidence in strategy selection
- **Provider Telemetry** — latency snapshots, fallback records, queue-wait metrics per provider
- **Provider Comparison Dashboard** — side-by-side latency/failure/cost comparison with badge system (Fastest, Cheapest, Reliable, Noisy)
- **Admin Settings** — runtime performance config viewer, feature flags, provider health status, enable/disable toggles

### Development Tools
- **Live Preview** — real-time iframe preview of running applications with service switching
- **Runtime Analyzer** — auto-detects 15+ frameworks, databases, environment variables, and ports
- **Smart App Runner** — 3-strategy app launch (config / runtime analysis / Docker Compose fallback)
- **DB Provisioner** — Docker-based database provisioning with auto port conflict resolution
- **Git Management** — automatic version control with meaningful commits
- **CLI Monitor** — real-time CLI usage observatory (Claude, Codex, Cursor, Gemini probes)
- **Benchmark Harness** — `scripts/benchmark-providers.ts` CLI runner with markdown report generation for provider latency/cost analysis

### Project Management
- **Kanban Board** — visual task management with drag-and-drop and status filters
- **Sprint Board** — sprint lifecycle management with burndown charts and velocity tracking
- **Backlog Board** — work-item backlog with priority management and auto bug creation on review escalation
- **Ceremony Engine** — standup and retrospective automation
- **Agent Messaging** — inter-agent communication with threads, broadcast, and mentions
- **Policy Engine** — configurable task policies (block/warn/non-blocking) evaluated at task start
- **Diff Viewer** — side-by-side code diff visualization for generated changes

## Architecture

Oscorpex uses a monorepo architecture with a backend kernel, React console, shared packages, and provider adapters.

Normal task execution flows through the post-refactor execution boundary:

```txt
ExecutionEngine facade
  → TaskDispatcher
  → TaskExecutor
  → ProviderExecutionService
  → ProviderRegistry
  → ProviderAdapter
```

The legacy CLI runtime boundary remains for streaming, proposal processing, tests, and explicit legacy entry points. It is not the normal task execution path.

## Refactor Status

Execution refactor accepted at commit `85b3e34 Complete execution refactor batch`.
Technical debt closure batches completed through `9c18ba6 chore(types): reduce unsafe casts at kernel boundaries`.

Validated locally with:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm --filter @oscorpex/kernel test
pnpm --filter @oscorpex/task-graph test
pnpm --filter @oscorpex/provider-sdk test
```

Known non-blocking technical debt:

- legacy CLI runtime remains under `studio/legacy/` for compatibility, streaming, proposal processing, and test paths
- root CLI shim files remain for compatibility and test mocks
- some unsafe casts remain in tests, routes, DB row mappers, and adapters; production kernel boundary casts were reduced in the closure batch

## Database

PostgreSQL with 85+ tables including: `projects`, `project_plans`, `phases`, `tasks`, `project_agents`, `events`, `work_items`, `sprints`, `token_usage`, `agent_capabilities`, `agent_sessions`, `agent_episodes`, `agent_strategy_patterns`, `task_proposals`, `graph_mutations`, `replan_events`, `execution_goals`, `learning_patterns`, `provider_state`, `pipeline_runs`, `capability_grants`, `sandbox_sessions`, `sandbox_violations`, `provider_telemetry`, `cli_usage_snapshots`, `replan_patches`, `agent_instances`, `provider_runtime_registry`, `runtime_heartbeats`, `approvals`, `approval_events`, `audit_events`, `security_events`, `incidents`, `incident_events`, `operator_actions`, `operator_flags`

All migrations use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` / `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` for idempotency. Schema applied at startup via `db-bootstrap.ts`.

## How It Works

1. **Describe** your project idea through the PM chat interface
2. **Plan** — AI Planner conducts intake questions, then generates phased plans with task dependencies and agent assignments
3. **Execute** — Pipeline engine dispatches tasks to specialized agents via DAG wave ordering, with complexity-based model routing, policy profile awareness, sandbox isolation, and budget control
4. **Review** — Code reviewers evaluate output with iterative revision loops; rejected tasks get auto-retried with tier-bumped models
5. **Learn** — Episodic memory and cross-project learning improve strategy selection over time; adaptive replanner adjusts plans at phase boundaries
6. **Preview** — Live preview of your running application with runtime analysis and auto-configuration

## Operator Governance (Control Plane)

Oscorpex includes a dedicated **Control Plane** for operators to monitor and manage the system:

### Dashboard (/studio/control-plane)
- **Summary Cards** — pending approvals, active agents, cooldown providers, open incidents, over-budget projects
- **Provider Health** — online/degraded/cooldown/offline counts with cooldown remaining
- **Approval Queue** — real-time SLA tracking (age, expires soon, escalated)
- **Incident Feed** — acknowledge, assign, resolve, reopen, add notes

### Operator Actions
All operator actions require `actor` and `reason` and are permanently audit-logged:

| Action | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Pause Queue | `POST /actions/pause-queue` | Stop task dispatching |
| Resume Queue | `POST /actions/resume-queue` | Resume task dispatching |
| Reset Cooldown | `POST /actions/reset-cooldown` | Clear provider cooldown |
| Disable Provider | `POST /actions/provider-disable` | Mark provider unavailable |
| Enable Provider | `POST /actions/provider-enable` | Mark provider available |
| Retry Task | `POST /actions/retry-task` | Re-queue a failed task |
| Cancel Task | `POST /actions/cancel-task` | Cancel a queued/running task |

### Governance Endpoints
- `GET /api/studio/summary` — Dashboard aggregations
- `GET /api/studio/provider-ops` — Provider operational status
- `GET /api/studio/queue-health` — Queue paused state and metrics
- `GET /api/studio/policy/summary` — Global policy overview
- `GET /api/studio/policy/projects/:id` — Project-level policy details
